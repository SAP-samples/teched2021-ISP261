# ISP261 - Extend SAP Commerce Cloud Through Cloud Native Functions and Services

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2021 session called ISP261 - Extend SAP Commerce Cloud Through Cloud Native Functions and Services.

## Overview

In this session we will walk you through an overview of how to extend SAP Commerce Cloud using SAP Cloud Platform, Kyma runtime - a Kubernetes-based open-source platform. You will learn how to use microservices combined with serverless functions and events to create a modern extension scenario for Commerce that will fit your business needs. Furthermore, understand why using this platform is the recommended approach to build extension scenarios and drive innovation for your Intelligent Enterprise.

## Requirements

The requirements to follow the exercises in this repository are:

- Get a free trial account on SAP BTP; see this [tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html).
- Enable Kyma runtime on your newly created SAP BTP account; see this [tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-kyma-getting-started.html).

It is very important that the steps above are completed before the day of the session, they will enable you to follow the rest of the exercises.

Furthermore, while not obligatory, for this session you also need a local development system. You will have a better experience if you go through and complete [the prerequisites](./prerequisites.md).
