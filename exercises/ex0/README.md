# Getting Started

In this section, you will have a look at the extension scenario that will be implemented and get access to the systems that will enable the next steps.

## Extension Scenario

In this workshop you will be implementing the extension scenario depicted below. JohnDoe Electronics has a feature idea that will greatly increase their customer experience and satisfaction. They would like to add the following feature to their electronics shop, every time a customer completes an order that is greater than $200, JonDoe will send a personalized email to the customer and attach a coupon for their next purchase.

// Extension Picture

In the upcoming exercises, you will be implementing this scenario using the Kyma runtime for extending CCv2.

## Prepare the environment

In order to implement the scenario above, you will have to get access to the following systems:

1. A CCv2 tenant
2. A SAP BTP, Kyma runtime free trial

In order to facilitate the live session, the CCv2 tenants will be provided accordingly to users attending.

## Explore the systems

Finally, before you start implementing the scenario, it's helpful to have a quick look and refresher at the main dashboards you'll be using in the following exercises.

1. CCv2 Backoffice
2. CCv2 Storefront
3. SAP BTP
4. Kyma Dashboard

## Summary

Congratulations, now you have understood the extension scenario and taken the first steps towards implementing it.
